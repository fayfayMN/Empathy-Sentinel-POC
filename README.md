Empathy Sentinel: A Civil Tech "Software Patch" for Behavioral Integrity
"Upgrading the system logic of human leadership through Data Science."

📌 Project VisionIn modern society, our "social hardware" (courts, hiring, and family law) often runs on outdated "code" that fails to identify high-conflict behavioral patterns.
Empathy Sentinel is a Civil Tech initiative designed to act as a diagnostic support layer. 
By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), this project aims to detect markers of high-conflict personalities (HCP) and Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) to protect the most vulnerable—specifically immigrants and survivors.

The Humanity First Principle: 
We do not replace human judgment. We provide "Decision Support" that empowers judges, recruiters, and mediators with data-driven insights to ensure safety and integrity.

Tech Stack & MethodologyLanguage: 
Python 3.10+NLP Engines: Hybrid model using Regex (for baseline logic) and Transformer-based models (for sentiment and context analysis).
Frameworks: Hugging Face, Scikit-learn, TextBlob.
Core Logic: Derived from Bill Eddy’s BIFF method (Brief, Informative, Friendly, Firm).

Modular Architecture (The Roadmap)To manage the $9/10$ difficulty of this project, development is split into "Patches":
1. The BIFF-Analyzer (Current Phase)A lightweight tool that audits communication (emails, transcripts) for "Aggression Spikes" vs. "Informative Facts."
2. The Guardian Council ProtocolA governance layer where outputs are audited by a human-in-the-loop (HITL) panel of legal and psychological experts.
3.  Neuro-Neutral Ethics LayerA bias-mitigation engine designed to distinguish between cultural communication styles (e.g., direct vs. indirect) and manipulative behavior.

Privacy & Compliance (MCDPA / TRAIGA)We prioritize security for "New Americans" and survivors:
 Zero-Retention Policy: Data is processed in-memory and purged immediately.
 De-identification: Names and locations are "masked" before analysis to prevent re-identification.
 Explainable AI (XAI): Every "flag" is clickable, showing the user exactly which sentence triggered the alert and why.
 
 Getting StartedThis project is currently in the "Research & Development" phase.Bash# Clone the repository
