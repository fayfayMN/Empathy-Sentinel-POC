# Contributing to Empathy Sentinel
## 🛡 Our "Humanity First" Standards
By contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our core values:
* **Privacy First:** We never collect or store identifiable personal data.
* **Neuro-Neutrality:** We actively work to mitigate bias against cultural communication styles and neurodivergence.
* **Non-Diagnostic Support:** Our tool is for decision support, not clinical diagnosis.

## 🧬 How You Can Help
We are currently seeking contributions in three key areas:

### 1. Technical (NLP & Data Science)
* Improving the **BIFF-Analyzer** logic.
* Developing XAI (Explainable AI) modules so every flag is traceable.
* Implementing zero-retention data pipelines.

### 2. Legal & Ethical (The Guardian Council)
* Auditing our logic for compliance with **MCDPA** (Minnesota) and **TRAIGA** (Texas).
* Reviewing "Bias Deltas" to ensure cultural fairness.

### 3. Subject Matter Experts
* Mediators and Family Law attorneys providing anonymized "use cases."
* Psychologists refining our behavioral markers based on Bill Eddy’s frameworks.

## 🛠 Workflow for Developers
1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  Create a **Feature Branch** (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3.  Ensure your code is documented and follows the **zero-retention** protocol.
4.  Open a **Pull Request (PR)**. All PRs must be reviewed by at least one member of the Guardian Council before merging.

## 📝 Reporting Issues
If you find a "Logic Bug" (e.g., a false positive that flags a certain cultural communication style as aggressive), please open an **Issue** immediately with the label `Bias-Alert`.
