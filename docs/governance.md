# Empathy Sentinel: Governance & Ethics Framework
To ensure "Humanity First" outcomes, this project is overseen by a multi-disciplinary Guardian Council. No significant logic changes (e.g., NPD marker thresholds) can be merged without a 2/3 majority vote from the following roles:
* **Legal Auditor:** Ensures compliance with TRAIGA (Texas), MCDPA (Minnesota), and Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE 707).
* **Psychological Advisor:** Validates that NLP markers align with clinical frameworks (e.g., High Conflict Institute standards).
* **Ethics Lead:** Monitors for "Bias Deltas" specifically affecting neurodivergent and immigrant communities.
* **Technical Lead:** Oversees Zero-Retention data architecture.

## 2. High-Risk AI Compliance (2026 Standards)
Under the **Minnesota Consumer Data Privacy Act (MCDPA)**, Empathy Sentinel operates as a "Decision Support Tool," not an "Automated Decision System."
* **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** The AI provides flags; a human professional (judge, mediator, or HR lead) must make the final determination.
* **Right to Explanation:** Users flagged by the system have the right to view the "Clickable Evidence" (XAI) generated by the model.

## 3. Data Integrity & "Zero-Retention"
* **No Persistent Storage:** Input text is processed in temporary RAM and purged immediately after analysis.
* **Anonymization:** All PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is scrubbed at the regex layer before reaching the NLP engine.

## 4. Neuro-Neutrality Commitment
We recognize that NPD markers can overlap with cultural communication styles.
* **Adversarial Audits:** We conduct quarterly testing against diverse datasets (e.g., English as a Second Language speakers) to ensure "Directness" is not mislabeled as "Aggression."
